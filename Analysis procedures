Project Overview:

My task involves a thorough analysis of a comprehensive dataset, featuring intricate details of bookings, guest demographics, distribution channels, and financial metrics. By applying my analytical prowess, I aim to extract meaningful insights that will not only inform operational improvements but also contribute to the overall success of SHG in delivering unparalleled hospitality.
